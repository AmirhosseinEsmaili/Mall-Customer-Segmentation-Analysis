# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
Unsupervised Machine Learning (using K-Means). The goal of this project is to perform an unsupervised clustering analysis on the "Mall Customers" dataset. By using the K-Means algorithm on key features like `Age`, `Annual Income`, and `Spending Score`, I will identify distinct, actionable customer personas.
